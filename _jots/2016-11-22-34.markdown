Q: *Trespasser* is unfortunately known for not bringing in the sales it deserved. If you could change one thing about the production what would you do differently?

A: I would have assigned the 25-year-old Seamus a strong producer, who would have bullied him to restrict the scope of innovation to something manageable.
