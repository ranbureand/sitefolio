And all of a sudden I live in a world where I can have a conversation with something that for all the world seems to be human and do all of this, and it’s not, it’s not intelligent, it doesn’t understand anything, it doesn’t think, it doesn’t have feelings…

But I forget that over and over and over again when I talk to these systems.

These systems are in fact designed to make you forget that: they speak to you in the first person, they are setup as a chat bot in a way you can have a conversation that goes back and forth and when you forget that, you fall into all of these traps of assuming that the system can do things that it can’t, that it knows things it can’t […].
