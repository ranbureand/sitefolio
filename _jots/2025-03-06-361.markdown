Imagine that you take the first page of *The Hobbit* and xerox it. Then copy the copy. Copy the copy of the copy. And so on. Do this a hundred times or so, and youâ€™ll end up with something that looks like television static.

Something similar happens when you iteratively train an AI on the output of previous AIs. After a few iterations, the output degrades markedly as the later models no longer have an accurate representation of the original training data. This phenomenon is known as model collapse.
