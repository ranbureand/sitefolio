Facebook is such a big distributor of traffic that no news operation can afford to ignore it, but it is not a neutral distributor. It’s a bit like if the paperboy went rogue, decided to put a gun to the temple of a newspaper editor and barked that unless he gets a cut of the sales he’ll pull the trigger.
