The project started from an extensive image archive consisting of approximately a thousand raw pictures taken by photographers Michael Danner, Dominik Gigler, Monika Höfler, Jörg Koopmann, Verena Kathrein, Andrew Phelps, and Matthias Ziegler.

How could the correlations between the pictures in such a heterogenous[^heterogenity] set be maximized within the “constraints” of the book form?

        h="2" w="3"

The source of inspiration for the innovative layout of *Sight-_Seeing* came from a couple of misprinted photographic books, where the pictures—due to an incorrect [imposition](http://printwiki.org/Imposition "imposition on PrintWiki") of pages on press sheets—slightly crossed the fold. This printing error served as the starting point for the book’s layout design.

<div class="figures">
    {% include image.html
        size="l"
        h="2" w="3"
        src="sight_seeing_6383.jpg"
        alt="A double page spread of the book Sight-_Seeing."
        color="#BEAEA1"
    %}
    {% include image.html
        size="l"
        h="2" w="3"
        src="sight_seeing_6388.jpg"
        alt="A double page spread of the book Sight-_Seeing."
        color="#BEAEA1"

Firstly, after a careful collaborative selection, the pictures were reduced in number and divided into twelve thematic groups, with a [16-pages](http://printwiki.org/Octavo "16-pages / octavo on PrintWiki") [signature](http://printwiki.org/Signature "signature on PrintWiki") allocated to each group.

Secondly, the layout of the pictures was designed to consider not only the two pages of a single spread but also all others within the same 16-page signature. This approach ensured that the images related not only to those on adjacent pages but also to those on subsequent pages through the crossing of the fold, creating a new multi-directional flow of reading in addition to the usual one-directional sequence.

        size="xl"
        h="5" w="6"

        alt="Making of the photobook Sight-_Seeing."
        color="#BEAEA1"
    %}
</div>

The adopted strategy enabled the creation of multiple, otherwise physically impossible connections between the images in such a heterogeneous set.

        size="l"
        h="2" w="3"

        color="#BEAEA1"
    %}
    {% include image.html
        size="xl"
        h="2" w="3"

        alt="A double page spread of the book Sight-_Seeing."
        color="#BEAEA1"
    %}
</div>

By peeking out from the fold, the main picture on p. _09_11 is related not only to the photos on its own spread but also to those on pp. _09_06–_09_07.

One of the various 16-page signature mock-ups used during the book’s design: an essential tool for laying out images without going crazy.

[^heterogenity]: heterogeneous due to the different photographers’ approaches.
