The beginnings of the project was an incredibly large image archive, made up by around a thousand raw pictures taken by the photographers Michael Danner, Dominik Gigler, Monika Höfler, Jörg Koopmann, Verena Kathrein, Andrew Phelps and Matthias Ziegler.

How could the correlations between the pictures of such an heterogenous[^heterogenity] set be maximized within the “constraints” of the book form?

</div>

The source of inspiration for the innovative layout solution of *Sight-_Seeing* came from a couple of misprinted photographic books, which pictures—due to a wrong [imposition](http://printwiki.org/Imposition "imposition on PrintWiki") of pages on press sheets—were slightly crossing the fold. Such a printing error was taken as a starting point for conceiving the layout of the book.

Firstly, after a keen collaborative selection, the pictures were reduced in number and divided into twelve thematic groups, and a [16-pages](http://printwiki.org/Octavo "16-pages / octavo on PrintWiki") [signature](http://printwiki.org/Signature "signature on PrintWiki") was reserved to each of them.

Secondly, the layout of the pictures was designed taking into account not only the two pages of a single spread, but also all other ones belonging to the same 16-pages signature, so that images are related not only with those of the adjacent page, but also with those of the following ones by means of the crossing of the fold, whereupon the usual, consecutive flow of reading can be abandoned in favor of this very new one.

The adopted strategy allowed the creation of multiple and otherwise physically impossible connections between the images of such an heterogeneous set.

By peeking out from the fold, the main picture of p. _09_11 is set in a relation not only with the photos of its own spread, but also with the ones of [pp. _09_06-_09_07](#sight_seeing_6372.jpg).

One of various 16-pages signature mock-ups used during the designing of the book: an essential tool for laying out images without becoming crazy.

[^heterogenity]: Heterogeneous due to the different photographers’ approaches.
