The installation correlates two different yet comparable **web image archives**: **the first**, potentially infinite. is continuously powered by users through the site Fortune Cookie, while **the second**, actually finite, consists of images retrieved from a sample of ten image search engines.

    {% include image.html
        size="l"
        h="2" w="3"
        src="fortune_cookie_64.jpg"
        alt="A picture of the installation Fortune Cookie."
        color="#E3E4DF"
    %}
</div>

In **the first** archive, links to the images submitted by participants and collected through the site are aggregated into a single cluster and printed on-the-fly using a digital printer installed on-site.

<div class="figures">
    {% include image.html
        size="xl"
        h="2" w="3"
        src="fortune_cookie_16.jpg"
        alt="A picture of the installation Fortune Cookie."
        color="#E3E4DF"
    %}
</div>

**The second** archive is populated with the first fifty results returned for the query *dream*, retrieved from a sample of ten different **image search engines**[^search-engines].

> “People who think that search engines are completely objective ignore the fact that every search engine has its own philosophy, every search engine has its own set of **algorithms** and those algorithms encode the **ranking philosophy** of that search engine, […] every search engine is going to have **different ideas** of what the ideal set of search results is […].”

Starting from the unusual **assumption** that each search engine has its own **subjectivity** and a distinct, univocal **idea** of what *dream* should be, all clusters of images are treated and introduced as if they were collected by an actual **test subject**.

The first physical counterpart of ***Fortune Cookie*** was set up as a postcard installation at [West Space](http://westspace.org.au/ "The West Space gallery site") gallery during the exhibition *[Can we please play the internet?](http://canwepleaseplaytheinter.net/ "Can we please play the internet / Exhibition site")*, curated by Rosemary Willink for the *[Next Wave](http://nextwave.org.au "The Next Wave festival site")* festival.
