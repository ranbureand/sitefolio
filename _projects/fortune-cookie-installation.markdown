The installation correlates two different but comparable **web image archives**: **the first**—potentially infinite—one is being continuously powered by users through the site Fortune Cookie, while **the second**—actually finite—one consists of images retrieved from a sample of ten image search engines.

<div class="figures">
    {% include image.html
        size="l"
        h="2" w="3"
        src="fortune_cookie_64.jpg"
        alt="A picture of the installation Fortune Cookie."
        color="#E3E4DF"
    %}
</div>

In **the first** archive, the links to the images submitted by the participants and collected through the site are aggregated together in a single cluster and printed on-the-fly by means of a digital printer installed on the spot.

<div class="figures">
    {% include image.html
        size="xl"
        h="2" w="3"
        src="fortune_cookie_16.jpg"
        alt="A picture of the installation Fortune Cookie."
        color="#E3E4DF"
    %}
</div>

**The second** archive is populated with the first fifty results returned in response to the query *dream*, retrieved from a **sample** of ten different **image search engines**[^search-engines].

> “People who think that search engines are completely objective ignore the fact that every search engine has its own philosophy, every search engine has its own set of **algorithms** and those algorithms encode the **ranking philosophy** of that search engine, […] every search engine is going to have **different ideas** of what the ideal set of search results is […].”

Starting from the unusual **assumption** that every search engine has indeed its own **subjectivity** and thus a clear, univocal **idea** of what *dream* should be, all clusters of images are treated and introduced as if they were collected by an out-and-out **test subject**.
