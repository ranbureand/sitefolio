As with the first edition, this project also began with an extensive image archive consisting of pictures taken by photographers Hans Herbig, Verena Kathrein, Jörg Koopmann, Regina Recht, Sebastian Schels, [Alexander Ziegler](http://alexanderziegler.com/ "Alexander Ziegler’s website") , and Richard Walch.

In this second edition, the images were visually leveled to varying degrees by the omnipresent whiteness of the snow, a shared feature that made visually matching them far more challenging than with the previous set, due to the lack of strong contrasts.

This drawback was overcome by eliminating the margins between images, thereby leveraging the subtle differences in the gradations of whiteness to reveal the inner visual quality of each picture.

The map of Tirol shows the photographers’ paths and the approximate locations of all the shots included in the photobook.
