**Open source** authors and contributors need much **more love** from the community: those who initiate and share their projects, as well as those who participate and collaborate to constantly improve them, merit a **big thank-you**.

The intent behind *Yo, This is Cool* is having a space where you can thank the amazing people behind your favorite open source projects on GitHub.

Each letter of the *Index* page is associated to an interesting **term** as **food for thought**, which short definition introduces the related letter subpage.

A **[mandrake root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandrake "Mandrake on Wikipedia")** as a **mascot** introduces the site: whenever you add a cool open source project to appreciate, she pops out and encourages you to scream your thank-you out loud.
