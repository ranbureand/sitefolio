**Open source** authors and contributors need much **more love** from the community. Those who initiate and share their projects, as well as those who participate and collaborate to continually improve them, deserve a **big thank-you**.

The intent behind *Yo, This is Cool!* is to create a space where you can thank the amazing people behind your favorite open source projects on GitHub.

Each letter of the *Index* page is associated with an interesting **term** as **food for thought**, with a brief definition that introduces the related letter subpage.

A **[mandrake root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandrake "Mandrake on Wikipedia")** serves as the site’s **mascot**: whenever you add a cool open source project to appreciate, she pops out and encourages you to shout your thank-you out loud.
