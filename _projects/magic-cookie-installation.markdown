At present every web user is enclosed in a **personalized information bubble**[^bubble] generated by algorithms s/he has no direct control upon.

The same **Google**, the most used search engine to this day, personalizes search results provided to users on the base of both **objective data** — the place where the research is made, browser and computer used, … — and **subjective data** — access to a Google account, activation of its Google Web History, …. Users’ **access to information** is thus **shaped** by multiple variables.

*Magic Cookie* aims at investigating such a shaping by **correlating** the different personalized **Google Images search results** of a sample of ten **volunteers** coming from various cultures and based all over the world.

The experiment required each volunteer to have a Google Account and its **Google Web History[^personalization] turned on**. Each volunteer was asked to sign in to her/his **Google Account**, google the keyword ***dream*** in **Google Images** and collect all **thumbnails** appearing in the corresponding search result page.

[^bubble]: “An invisible revolution has taken place is the way we use the net, but the increasing **personalization of information** by search engines such as Google threatens to **limit** our **access** to information and enclose us in a self-reinforcing worldview.” — Eli Pariser, *The Filter Bubble*, The Observer, United Kingdom.
