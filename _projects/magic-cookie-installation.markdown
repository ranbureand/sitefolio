Currently, every web user is enclosed in a **personalized information bubble**[^bubble] generated by algorithms that they have no direct control over.

**Google**, the most widely used search engine today, personalizes search results based on both **objective data**—such as the user’s location, browser, and device—and **subjective data**—such as whether the user is logged into a Google account or has activated Google Web History. As a result, users’ **access to information** is **shaped** by multiple variables.

*Magic Cookie* aims to investigate this shaping by **correlating** the different personalized **Google Images search results** from a sample of ten **volunteers** from diverse cultures and various global locations.

The experiment required each volunteer to have a Google Account with **Google Web History[^personalization] turned on**. Volunteers were asked to sign into their **Google Account**, search for the keyword ***dream*** in **Google Images**, and collect all **thumbnails** from the resulting search page.

[^bubble]: > An invisible revolution has taken place is the way we use the net, but the increasing **personalization of information** by search engines such as Google threatens to **limit** our **access** to information and enclose us in a self-reinforcing worldview.
