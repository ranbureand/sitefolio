The experimental web image archive aims at replicating on a small scale the way a **human image search engine**[^flesh] might work.

As opposed to a typical image search engine, which returns a set of images based on a user’s query, a human image search engine is **powered by multiple users**, who consciously search and return visual responses to each other[^process].

For the sake of the experiment’s simplicity and consistency, the **replication** is kept at a **small scale**, that is all the collaborative efforts collected through the site focus on replying to just one, single predefined **query word**: ***dream***.

<div class="figures">
    {% include image.html
        size="m"
        h="988" w="960"
        src="fortune_cookie_site_index_360_00.jpg"
        alt="A screenshot of the website Fortune Cookie."
        color="#6362E1"
    %}
    {% include image.html
        size="m"
        h="988" w="960"
        src="fortune_cookie_site_call_360_00.jpg"
        alt="A screenshot of the website Fortune Cookie."
        color="#6362E1"
    %}
</div>

Web travelers are invited to populate the archive by submitting their own visual interpretation in response to the predefined query word/abstract concept *dream*.

The **query word** ***dream*** is chosen because it is an **abstract** term, and thus it poses a problematic case to image search engines, since it is susceptible of **multiple subjective interpretations**[^retrieval], and an image search engine does not know beforehand which interpretation the user is really looking for.

In the beginning the **interface** of the archive was designed to work similarly to the one of an ordinary image search engine: regretfully a **compromise** with **copyright laws**[^laws] on the Internet was required, so the archive was adapted to its current state.

After having read that even using a **thumbnail** counterpart of a **copyrighted image** in a web page for the mere sake of documenting such resource—like image search engines usually do—could be well enough to be deemed as **copyright infringement**, it was preferred not to use any thumbnails extracted from the originals at all.

For the above reason, all the thumbnails of the images collected in the archive are generated by **scrambling** the order of the **pixels** of their original counterparts.

<div class="figures">
    {% include image.html
        size="m"
        h="1344" w="1088"
        src="fortune_cookie_site_installation_768_00.jpg"
        alt="A screenshot of the website Fortune Cookie."
        color="#6362E1"
    %}
</div>

The digital image archive was correlated with a physical one in the installation of the same name set up on occasion of the exhibition ***Can we please play the internet?***.

[^flesh]: The grand-scale **collaboration** at the basis of a human image search engine would be similar to the one of a [human flesh search engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_flesh_search_engine "Human flesh search engine on Wikipedia"), but with a focus on images only.

[^process]: The goal is subverting the **top-down process** typical of standard search engines, and transforming it into a **bottom-up** one.

[^retrieval]: > “**Image retrieval** for abstract concepts is the search for image content that is not directly present in the image, but needs to be **inferred** from **background knowledge and experience**.”

    — Ron Besseling in *Designing an Image Retrieval Interface for Abstract Concepts Within the Domain of Journalism*.

[^laws]: Which are a **jungle**, so watch out for tigers!
