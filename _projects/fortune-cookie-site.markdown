The experimental web image archive aims to replicate on a small scale how a **human image search engine**[^flesh] might work.

Unlike a typical image search engine, which returns a set of images based on a user’s query, a human image search engine is **powered by multiple users** who consciously search for and return visual responses to each other[^process].

For the sake of simplicity and consistency, the **replication** is kept at a **small scale**; all collaborative efforts collected through the site focus on responding to just one predefined **query word**: ***dream***.

<div class="figures">
    {% include image.html
        size="m"
        h="988" w="960"
        src="fortune_cookie_site_index_360_00.jpg"
        alt="A screenshot of the website Fortune Cookie."
        color="#6362E1"
    %}
    {% include image.html
        size="m"
        h="988" w="960"
        src="fortune_cookie_site_call_360_00.jpg"
        alt="A screenshot of the website Fortune Cookie."
        color="#6362E1"
    %}
</div>

Web travelers are invited to populate the archive by submitting their own visual interpretation in response to the predefined query word or abstract concept *dream*.

The **query word** ***dream*** was chosen because it is an **abstract** term, posing a challenge for image search engines. The query word dream was chosen because it is an abstract term, posing a challenge for image search engines. As an abstract term, it is open to **multiple subjective interpretations**[^retrieval], and an image search engine cannot know in advance which interpretation the user is truly seeking.

Initially, the **interface** of the archive was designed to function similarly to that of a typical image search engine. However, a **compromise** with **copyright laws**[^laws] on the Internet became necessary, leading to its current form.

Upon learning that even using a **thumbnail** of a **copyrighted image** on a web page for documentation purposes—such as what image search engines typically do—could still be considered **copyright infringement**, it was decided not to use any thumbnails derived from the originals.

As a result, all the thumbnails of the images collected in the archive are generated by **scrambling** the order of the **pixels** from their original counterparts.

        h="1344" w="1088"

        alt="A screenshot of the website Fortune Cookie."
        color="#6362E1"
    %}
</div>

The digital image archive was connected to a physical one in the installation of the same name, set up on occasion of the exhibition ***Can we please play the internet?***.




[^flesh]: The large-scale **collaboration** at the basis of a human image search engine would resemble that of a [human flesh search engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_flesh_search_engine "Human flesh search engine on Wikipedia"), but with a focus solely on images.

[^process]: The goal is to subvert the **top-down process** typical of standard search engines, transforming it into a **bottom-up** approach.

[^retrieval]: > “**Image retrieval** for abstract concepts is the search for image content that is not directly present in the image, but needs to be **inferred** from **background knowledge and experience**.”

    — Ron Besseling in *Designing an Image Retrieval Interface for Abstract Concepts Within the Domain of Journalism*.

[^laws]: A **jungle** of regulations—so watch out for tigers!
