# Andrea Buran’s Site. Fifth Edition.

The code for my personal site, [andreaburan.com](https://www.andreaburan.com "Andrea Buran’s Site"), is based on this repository.

This site is:

+ designed and developed in the browser
+ written in Kramdown
+ generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll")
+ scripted in JavaScript
+ styled from scratch using SCSS
+ typeset with [IBM Plex Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono "IBM Plex Mono in Google Fonts"), [IBM Plex Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Sans "IBM Plex Sans in Google Fonts"), and [IBM Plex Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Serif "IBM Plex Serif in Google Fonts")

It is a playground in constant evolution where I experiment, learn, and try new things.

The favicon is:

+ designed in Figma
+ generated using [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/ "RealFaviconGenerator")
