# Andrea Buran’s Site. Fifth Edition.

The code of my personal site, [www.andreaburan.com](http://www.andreaburan.com "Andrea Buran’s Site"), is based on this repository.

This site is:

+ designed and developed in the browser
+ written in Kramdown
+ generated through [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll")
+ scripted in JavaScript
+ styled from scratch in SCSS
+ typesetted in [IBM Plex Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono "IBM Plex Mono in Google Fonts"), [Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Sans "IBM Plex Sans in Google Fonts") and [Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Serif "IBM Plex Serif in Google Fonts")

and it is a playground in constant evolution where I try, experiment, and learn.

Its favicon is:

+ designed in Figma
+ generated using the [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/ "RealFaviconGenerator")
