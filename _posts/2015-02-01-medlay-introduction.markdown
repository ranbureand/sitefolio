*Medlay* (*medley* + *lay*) is a **hybrid media form** for creating a multimedia artifact that narrates a story or communicates an idea on the Web.

A **media form** is to a **media artifact** as comics is to a particular comic book or as cinema is to a particular movie: the latter is a specific application of the former.

*Medlay* is hybrid because it combines the strengths of two popular media forms: **cinema** and **comics**. For example, the moving image in cinema or the variably sized and shaped panel in comics.

Specifically, it fuses the one-image-at-a-time **temporal narration** typical of cinema with the multi-images **spatial narration** characteristic of comics.

</div>

    caption="Multi-images spatial narration. Hirohiko Araki, *Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure*."

</div>

Two proof-of-concept prototypes have been created to demonstrate the potential uses of Medlay: *[The Last Dispatch]({{ site.baseurl }}/project/medlay-the-last-dispatch.html)* and *[Ubik Chap. 6]({{ site.baseurl }}/project/medlay-ubik.html)*. Both narrate a short story.

    caption="A screenshot from the proof of concept *Ubik Chap. 6*."

</div>

Viewers of a *Medlay* artifact can **actively** and **freely** **explore**[^exploration] the time and space of a multimedia narration.

The **watching time** of a *Medlay* artifact is not dictated by the roll of moving images as it is in a movie, allowing viewers to interact with the narrative sequence in an **order** and **pace** of their own choosing.
