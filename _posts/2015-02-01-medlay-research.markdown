I was able to further refine the concept of Medlay during my graduate thesis[^thanks], which aimed to compare the **cinema** and **comics media forms** and formulate a new creative way to **crossbreed** them on the Web.

Below is the main reasoning behind my thesis:

### Remediation

The relationship between the two media of cinema and comics is a long story of competition and reciprocal **remediation**[^remediation].

The term remediation does **not** refer to the **transposition of contents**[^transposition] between cinema and comics, but rather to the reciprocal borrowing and reshaping of their media forms by both.

<div class="figures">
  {% include image.html
    size="m"
    h="960" w="640"
    src="batman_00.jpg"
    alt="A cover of Detective Comics featuring Batman and Robin, DC Comics, 1940."

    color="#252525"

</div>

A practical example of **remediation** is the way the movie *Sin City*—a transposition of the graphic novel of the same name—has remediated a typical device of the comics media form: the ***splash page***.

> Through “splash pages” […] comics have the distinctive potential to convey in purely graphic terms the importance of a (literally) “big” moment in the story.

    src="sin_city_00.jpg"
    alt="A splash page from the graphic novel Sin City."
    caption="A splash page from the graphic novel Sin City. Frank Miller, *Sin City*."
    color="#252525"
  %}
</div>

Restricted by the <quote>film’s seemingly fixed, invisible frame</quote> the movie remediates and reshapes the “splash page” device through camera movement and the artificially frozen pose of the jumping character.

    color="#252525"
  %}
</div>

### Digital revolution

**Before** the digital revolution, these reciprocal remediations were always limited by different production, recording, transmission, and reproduction technologies.

<div class="figures">
  {% include video-embed.html
    size="m"
    h="224" w="300"
    src="cinema_technology_00"
    color="#252525"
  %}
</div>

<div class="figures">
  {% include video-embed.html
    size="m"
    h="224" w="300"
    src="comics_technology_00"
    color="#252525"
  %}
</div>

**After** the digital revolution, the technological differences between the two cultural forms—absorbed by the World Wide Web—have been reset. However, in most cases, cinema and comics have continued to be considered and remediated separately.

<div class="figures">
  {% include image.html
    size="m"
    h="1280" w="960"
    src="beartato_00.jpg"
    alt="A strip from the web comic NEDROID."
    caption="Anthony Clark, *NEDROID* web comic."
    color="#252525"
  %}
</div>

Is it possible to create a new **hybrid media form** that integrates the characteristics of cinema and comics that once seemed incompatible, now that the two mediums potentially differ only in their respective processes?

<div class="figures">
  {% include image.html
    size="m"
    h="720" w="1280"
    src="motion_comics_00.jpg"
    alt="A screenshot taken from a Marvel motion comic."
    caption="In my opinion, *Marvel Motion Comics* are not comics; their media form is, in fact, that of cartoon cinema through and through. Marvel Motion Comics, *Spider Woman*."
    color="#252525"
  %}
</div>

<div class="figures">
  {% include image.html
    size="m"
    h="720" w="1280"
    src="motion_comics_01.jpg"
    alt="A screenshot taken from a Marvel motion comic."
    caption="Marvel Motion Comics, *Spider Woman*."
    color="#252525"
  %}
</div>

### Sequential art

To assess the potential for interbreeding between the two cultural forms, cinema and comics have been subsumed under the broader concept of **sequential art**: <quote>the arrangement of pictures or images and words to narrate a story or dramatize an idea</quote>—a definition created in 1985 by **Will Eisner**[^source-1] and expanded in 1994 by **Scott McCloud**[^source-2]. This concept has been used to compare cinema and comics, highlighting their affinities and differences.

<div class="figures">
  {% include image.html
    size="m"
    h="1680" w="848"
    src="understanding_comics_00.jpg"
    alt="An excerpt from the non-fiction work Understanding Comics."
    caption="Scott McCloud, *Understanding Comics*."
    color="#252525"
  %}
</div>

The comparison analyzes the following points:

+ the respective procedures by which cinema and comics represent **time** and **space**, both at the level of the cinematic shot and the comics panel, as well as at the level of the sequence of shots and panels;

<div class="figures">
  {% include video-embed.html
    size="m"
    h="224" w="300"
    src="cinema_01"
    caption="In the cinematic media form, time is conveyed directly through the passage of time."
    color="#252525"
  %}
</div>

<div class="figures">
  {% include video-embed.html
    size="m"
    h="224" w="300"
    src="comics_time_space_00"
    caption="In the comics media form, time is conveyed indirectly through space. Carlos Trillo & Enrique Breccia, *Alvar Mayor*."
    color="#252525"
  %}
</div>

+ the differences between the cinema **split screen** and the comics **layout**;

<div class="figures">
  {% include image.html
    size="l"
    h="528" w="1280"
    src="conversation_with_other_women_00.jpg"
    alt="A screenshot from Conversation with Other Women."
    caption="Hans Canosa, *Conversation with Other Women*."
    color="#252525"

</div>

<div class="figures">

    alt="A double page from the manga Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure."
    caption="Multi-images spatial narration. Hirohiko Araki, *Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure*."
  %}
</div>

+ the differences between the **format** of the cinema shot and that of the comics panel;

<div class="figures">
  {% include image.html
    size="m"
    h="224" w="300"
    src="cinema_format_00.jpg"

    src="blame_00.jpg"
    alt="A page taken from the manga Blame!"
    caption="Tsutomu Nihei, *Blame!*."
  %}
</div>

+ the respective procedures by which cinema and comics represent **voice**, **noise** and **music**;

<div class="figures">
  {% include video-embed.html
    size="m"
    h="224" w="300"
    src="cinema_sound_00"
    color="#252525"

    alt="Scott McCloud speaking out loud in Making Comics."
    caption="Scott McCloud, *Making Comics*."
  %}
</div>

+ the respective procedures of **interpretation**.

<div class="figures">
  {% include image.html
    size="m"
    h="240" w="320"

  %}
</div>

### Hybrid media form

The **consequences** of the mid-1980s digital revolution[^digital-revolution], the emergence of the new digital media and their characteristics, and the new possibilities for producing dynamic images enabled by computers and the Web have been subsequently examined.

<div class="figures">
  {% include image.html
    size="m"
    h="656" w="1280"
    src="sin_city_01.jpg"
    alt="A screenshot from the making of the movie Sin City."
    caption="Robert Rodríguez & Frank Miller, *Sin City* making of."
  %}
</div>

<div class="figures">
  {% include image.html
    size="m"
    h="656" w="1280"
    src="sin_city_02.jpg"
    alt="A screenshot from the movie Sin City."
    caption="Robert Rodríguez & Frank Miller, *Sin City*."
  %}
</div>

In the end, a new **hybrid media form** that integrated both cinema and comics was proposed and demonstrated: *Medlay*.

This hybridization was made possible by the mid-1980s digital revolution and the ever-growing, eclectic and inclusive Web environment, which serves as a melting pot for various old media forms and has increasingly become a crucial distribution channel.
