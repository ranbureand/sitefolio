exordium: This series of articles ([Part 1](http://andreaburan.com/post/multilingual-sites-in-jekyll.html), [Part 2](http://andreaburan.com/post/multilingual-sites-in-jekyll-2.html), [Part 3](http://andreaburan.com/post/multilingual-sites-in-jekyll-3.html), [Part 4](http://andreaburan.com/post/multilingual-sites-in-jekyll-4.html)) and this extremely [basic *GitHub Pages* site](https://ranbureand.github.io/multilingual-experiment/) illustrate my approach to create a multilingual site in *[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll")*.

# Front Matter

## Pages

Here is how the front matter of a page looks like:

{% raw %}
``` yaml
---
layout: page

title: Stories
description: Stories.

language: en
language_reference: stories

published: true
---
```
{: .code-m }
{% endraw %}

But for the usual variables, we set two new ones, `language` to define the language of the page, and `language_reference` to relate different translations of the same page. The logic is based on the principle articulated in Sylvain Durandâ€™s *[Making Jekyll Multilingual](https://sylvaindurand.org/making-jekyll-multilingual/#principle "Making Jekyll
Multilingual")*.

For example, here is the front matter of the English page *Stories*:

{% raw %}
``` yaml
---
layout: page

title: Stories
description: Stories.

language: en
language_reference: stories

published: true
---
```
{: .code-m }
{% endraw %}

and here is the front matter of its Italian counterpart:

{% raw %}
``` yaml
---
layout: page

title: Storie
description: Storie.

language: it
language_reference: stories

published: true
---
```
{: .code-m }
{% endraw %}

Both pages have the variable `language_reference` set to `stories` so that they can be easily related.

We can use `language` to retrieve only the pages that have the same language, and `language_reference` to retrieve only the pages that return the same content translated in different languages.

## Posts

Here is how the front matter of a post looks like:

{% raw %}
``` yaml
---
layout: post

title: Hello World
description: Hello world.
date: 2021-01-01 00:00:00

language: en
language_reference: world

published: true
---
```
{: .code-m }
{% endraw %}

Again, but for the usual variables, we set two new ones, `language` to define the language of the post, and `language_reference` to relate different translations of the same post.

For example, here is the front matter of the English post *Hello World*:

{% raw %}
``` yaml
---
layout: post

title: Hello World
description: Hello world.
date: 2021-01-01 00:00:00

language: en
language_reference: world

published: true
---
```
{: .code-m }
{% endraw %}

and here is the front matter of its Italian counterpart:

{% raw %}
``` yaml
---
layout: post

title: Ciao Mondo
description: Ciao Mondo.
date: 2021-01-01 00:00:00

language: it
language_reference: world

published: true
---
```
{: .code-m }
{% endraw %}

Both posts have the variable `language_reference` set to `world` so that they can be easily related.

Again, we can use `language` to retrieve only the posts that have the same language, and `language_reference` to retrieve only the posts that return the same content translated in different languages.

# Data Files

## Snippets

We create a YAML [Data File](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/ "Data Files") named `snippets.yml` to store the different translations of the user interface copy as additional data in the `_data` subdirectory.

We then create a new variable named `snippets` in the `base.html` layout to shorten the code that we need to write to access the data contained in the `snippets.yml` file:

{% raw %}
``` liquid
{%- assign snippets = site.data.snippets %}
```
{: .code-m }
{% endraw %}

Since the `base.html` layout is the base for all the other layouts, if we place the variable `snippets` there, we can then access it from any other page.

Through this variable, we can write just `snippets.name_of_the_data_item` when accessing a data item rather than the full, longer `site.data.snippets.name_of_the_data_item`.

For example, the piece of code that generates the *Back to the Top* link at the bottom of the page:

{% raw %}
``` liquid
<a href="#{{ snippets.top[page.language] | slugify: 'latin' }}">{{ snippets.back[page.language] }}</a>
```
{: .code-xl }
{% endraw %}

uses the following variable:

{% raw %}
``` liquid
{{ snippets.back[page.language] }}
```
{: .code-m }
{% endraw %}

to retrieve the name of the link in the current selected language from the following lines in the `snippets.yml` data file:

{% raw %}
``` yaml
back:
  en: Back to the Top
  it: Torna in Cima

top:
  en: Top
  it: Cima
```
{: .code-m }
{% endraw %}
